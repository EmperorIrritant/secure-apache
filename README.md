# secure-apache
Building a secure apache httpd docker image.

This repository aims to gather all security best practices and build configurations for various usecases, including static and dynamic web content, reverse proxy, etc. The configuration building should eventually be available as shell script, ansible playbook, etc in both Debian and RedHat style httpd configuration.
